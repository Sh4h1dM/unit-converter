# unit-converter
This is my first official Github project!

First function I have added is Menu, this is the primary display to the console to allow the user to choose what measurement category they want to dive into. A wide range of categories is presented to not limit user's option and meet thier expectations. 

Moving on, the first big fuction I have started to create is distance / length. Here if the user has selected option one in the measurement menu, they are able to proceed to inserting thier value to converstion into desired output units. 

Retraced my steps back to the first function and changed code to enchance security and error handling. The if loops were incomplete and additionally pending debugging.
